# VBA-Projects
Collection of VBA projects made for a range of purposes (macro-enabled workbooks). Many of these documents were built to solve some silly little problem, others I spent more time on with the intent of them being more robust and useful, and still others I built just for fun (i.e. zDungeons and zCrosswords).

- Access Tracker: Imports an Objective.
- Baby Enigma: VBA implementation of [BabyEnigma](https://github.com/sjb-ch1mp/BabyEnigma).
- DocuMine: Searches for RegExp in XML, HTML and Text files. Produces an exportable report.
- Find Bits: Takes an integer and returns the closest number of bits.
- Hex Calc: Converts ASCII, Hex and decimal.
- ShowDirectory: Prints a directory in a workbook
- Task Register: A task tracker, with filtering and exportable reports.
- XTC Converter: Converts XML files to a CSV format.
- zCrosswords: A crossword game in which you can build crosswords, import and export saved games.
- zDungeons: A randomized dungeons crawler with monsters and mad lewtz.
